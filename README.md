- **Interactive Charts**: Revenue trends, expense breakdowns, stock levels, and more
- **Alert System**: Visual indicators for issues requiring attention
- **Multi-business Support**: Switch between different business configurations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Nix** (recommended) or Python 3.8+
- **Anthropic API key**

### Option 1: Using Nix (Recommended)

1. **Install Nix** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # Multi-user installation (recommended)
   sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
   
   # Enable flakes (required)
   echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
   ```

2. **Clone and setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd business_agent_system

```

## Configuration

The system uses YAML configuration files to define business parameters, agent settings, and simulation parameters. Key configuration sections:

### Business Settings
```yaml
business:
  name: "Sample Restaurant"
  type: "restaurant"
  description: "Full-service restaurant with dine-in and takeout"
```

### Agent Configuration
```yaml
agents:
  accounting:
    enabled: true
    check_interval: 300  # seconds
    anomaly_threshold: 0.25  # 25% variance triggers alert
  inventory:
    enabled: true
    reorder_lead_time: 3  # days
  hr:
    enabled: true
    max_labor_cost_percentage: 0.32  # 32% of revenue
```

### Simulation Settings
```yaml
simulation:
  enabled: true
  mode: "real_time"  # "historical", "real_time", or "off"
  historical_days: 90
```

## Agent Decision Making

Each agent uses Claude AI to analyze data and make intelligent decisions:

1. **Data Processing**: Agents continuously monitor their respective data streams
2. **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies anomalies, trends, and optimization opportunities  
3. **Decision Logging**: All agent decisions are logged with reasoning and confidence scores
4. **Action Recommendations**: Agents provide specific, actionable recommendations

### Example Agent Decision
```python
AgentDecision(
    agent_id="accounting_agent",
    decision_type="transaction_anomaly", 
    context={"transaction_amount": 5000, "variance": 0.45},
    reasoning="Transaction amount is 45% higher than typical...",
    action="Flag transaction for review",
    confidence=0.85
)
```

## Business Scenarios

The system includes pre-built scenarios for testing agent responses:

- **Cash Flow Crisis**: Simulates low cash situations
- **Seasonal Rush**: Models holiday/peak season increases
- **Equipment Failure**: Tests response to unexpected expenses
- **New Competitor**: Simulates market pressure scenarios

## API Reference

### Agent Health Check
```python
health_status = await agent.health_check()
# Returns: {"agent_id": "...", "status": "running", "decisions_count": 42}
```

### Generate Reports
```python
report = await agent.generate_report()
# Returns comprehensive summary with metrics and recent decisions
```

### System Status
```python
status = system.get_system_status()
# Returns overall system health and performance metrics
```

## Extending the System

### Adding New Agents
1. Create a new agent class inheriting from `BaseAgent`
2. Implement required abstract methods: `system_prompt`, `process_data`, `generate_report`
3. Add agent configuration to your YAML config file
4. Register the agent in `main.py`

### Adding New Business Types
1. Create a new configuration file in `config/`
2. Define business-specific parameters and thresholds
3. Update simulation profiles if needed
4. Customize agent prompts for the business domain

### Custom Data Models
1. Add new SQLAlchemy models in the `models/` directory
2. Create corresponding Pydantic models for validation
3. Update database initialization in the simulator
4. Add new data generators as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found"**
- Ensure you've set the environment variable: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key`

**"Configuration file not found"**  
- Check the file path and ensure the config file exists
- Use absolute paths if needed

**"Database connection error"**
- Check database URL in configuration
- Ensure SQLite database directory exists
- For PostgreSQL, verify connection parameters

**"No historical data"**
- Run with `--generate-historical N` to create sample data
- Check simulation settings in configuration

### Debug Mode
```bash
python main.py --config config/restaurant_config.yaml --debug
```

### Logs
Check logs in the `logs/` directory for detailed error information and agent decision history.

## Performance Considerations

- **Database**: SQLite is suitable for development; use PostgreSQL for production
- **API Rate Limits**: Monitor Anthropic API usage and adjust agent check intervals
- **Memory Usage**: Historical data generation can be memory-intensive for large datasets
- **Concurrent Agents**: All agents run concurrently; consider resource limits

## Security Notes

- Store API keys securely using environment variables
- Use secure database connections in production
- Implement proper authentication for API endpoints
- Regularly review agent decision logs for unexpected behavior
