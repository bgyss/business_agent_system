# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of Business Agent Management System seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Reporting Process

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: **bgyss@hey.com**
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Affected component(s)
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with severity assessment
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 30 days, others within 90 days

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No             |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Key Security
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Store API keys in environment variables only
- Use different API keys for development/production
- Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Monitor API usage for unexpected patterns

#### Database Security
- Use strong passwords for database connections
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
- Regularly backup and encrypt sensitive data
- Implement proper access controls

#### Deployment Security
- Run the application with minimal privileges
- Use firewalls to restrict network access
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Enable logging for security monitoring

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs from external sources
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Regular dependency security scanning

#### Environment Security
- Use separate environments for development/staging/production
- Implement proper CI/CD security practices
- Use secrets management for sensitive configuration
- Regular security testing in CI pipeline

## Known Security Considerations

### Anthropic API Integration
- API calls contain business data - ensure compliance with your data privacy requirements
- API keys provide access to your Anthropic account - protect them accordingly
- Review Anthropic's security practices and compliance certifications

### Business Data Handling
- Financial data is stored locally in the database
- Employee information requires appropriate privacy protection
- Consider data retention and deletion policies
- Implement backup encryption for sensitive data

### Third-party Dependencies
- We regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Automated security scanning is part of our CI/CD pipeline
- We aim to update security patches within 30 days of availability

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **Environment Isolation**: Configuration separated from code
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information not exposed in error messages
- **Logging**: Security events are logged appropriately

### Configurable Security Options

- **Database Encryption**: Support for encrypted database connections
- **API Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits for external API calls
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access for different system components
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of agent decisions and system changes

## Compliance Notes

### Data Privacy
- The system processes business financial and employee data
- Users are responsible for compliance with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Data is processed locally by default (not sent to third parties except Anthropic for AI processing)

### Financial Data
- Consider requirements for financial data protection in your jurisdiction
- Implement appropriate access controls for sensitive financial information
- Regular security assessments recommended for production deployments

## Security Auditing

### Self-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] API keys stored securely in environment variables
- [ ] Database connections use strong authentication
- [ ] SSL/TLS enabled for production deployments
- [ ] Regular backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Dependencies kept up to date
- [ ] Security logging enabled and monitored
- [ ] Access controls properly configured
- [ ] Incident response plan in place

### Professional Security Review

For production deployments handling sensitive data, we recommend:
- Professional security assessment
- Penetration testing
- Compliance audit (if required for your industry)
- Regular security monitoring

## Contact
